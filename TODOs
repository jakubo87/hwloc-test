1. use non-modifying (apart from adding a group VD) partitioning by the means of groups
each group is the solution of a query for optimisation according to constraints and functions
being a member of a certain group can be a condition of a following query
queries dont interact with each other, it is though possible to have multiple groups from each query
therefore there is no real use in removing groups....
